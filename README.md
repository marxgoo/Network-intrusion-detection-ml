# Network Intrusion Detection System 
**A Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)** is a security solution designed to monitor network traffic for suspicious or malicious activity. When it detects anything unusual such as known attack patterns, unauthorized access attempts, or policy violations—it generates alerts so administrators can take action.

# Data: 
The data used to train the classifier is taken from <a href="[https://example.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sampadab17/network-intrusion-detection)" target="_blank">Kaggle</a>. The dataset to be audited was provided which consists of a wide variety of intrusions simulated in a military network environment. It created an environment to acquire raw TCP/IP dump data for a network by simulating a typical US Air Force LAN.
